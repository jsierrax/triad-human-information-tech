# triad-human-information-tech
humanity is increasingly putting more trust on internet and there is not a method to ensure info is always accurate.
our youth google everything they need, instead of doing traditional research.  their consumption of information is based on the amount of followers, likes, and starts received by the source.  is this always valid? how can we ensure it is?  is a cybil attack a risk on influencing decisions in a given subject? Our youth indreasingly  trust the internet for medical recommendations and diagnostic, diets, habits, etc.
